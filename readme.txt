== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm seeing validation errors when trying to authenticate my MapKit JS credentials, what am I doing wrong? =

If you have WordPress installed in a subdirectory, then there is a [known issue](https://github.com/10up/maps-block-apple/issues/34) specifically related to this setup where the WordPress Admin URL is different from the site URL.  We're working on a [minor release](https://github.com/10up/maps-block-apple/milestone/3) to resolve this issue.

= Are there any MapKit JS rate limits? =

There is a free daily limit of 250,000 map views and 25,000 service calls per the Apple Developer Program membership.  For additional MapKit JS capacity needs you will need to [contact Apple directly](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/mapkitjs/).

= Can I see how many map views and service requests are made to my MapKit JS Private Key? =

Yes, you can track your MapKit JS useage on the [MapKit JS Developer Dashboard](https://maps.developer.apple.com/).  You can also monitor map initializations and service requests in realtime, or see up to a year of activity by day, week, month, or year via the MapKit JS Dashboard.
